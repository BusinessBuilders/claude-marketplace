# Tool Advisor Settings

Copy this file to `.claude/tool-advisor.local.md` and customize as needed.

```yaml
# Enable/disable proactive suggestions during conversations
# When enabled, tool-advisor will suggest relevant tools as you work
proactive_suggestions: true

# Auto-use threshold (0.0 - 1.0)
# If confidence score exceeds this, automatically use the tool
# Set to 1.0 to disable auto-use
auto_use_threshold: 0.90

# Suggestion threshold (0.0 - 1.0)
# Show suggestions when confidence exceeds this value
suggestion_threshold: 0.70

# Scan tools when starting a new conversation
scan_on_start: true

# How often to scan for new/updated tools
# Options: hourly, daily, manual
scan_frequency: hourly

# Directories to scan for tools
# Add or remove paths as needed
scan_directories:
  - ~/.claude/plugins/
  - ~/.claude/skills/
  - ./.claude/

# Output verbosity
# Options: quiet, normal, verbose
verbosity: normal

# Show match percentages in recommendations
# When true, displays confidence scores like "terraform-specialist (94% match)"
show_scores: true

# Exclude plugins matching these glob patterns
# Useful for ignoring deprecated or experimental plugins
exclude_plugins:
  - "legacy-*"
  - "deprecated-*"
  - "experimental-*"

# Preferred tools for specific task types
# Format: task_keyword: "preferred-plugin-name"
preferred_tools:
  deploy: "cloud-infrastructure"
  review: "code-review-ai"
  test: "tdd-workflows"
  debug: "debugging-toolkit"
  security: "security-scanning"
```

## Usage Notes

- **proactive_suggestions**: Disable this if you find suggestions distracting
- **auto_use_threshold**: Set high (0.95+) for conservative auto-use, lower (0.80) for aggressive
- **scan_frequency**: Use "manual" if you have many plugins and want to control scan timing
- **exclude_plugins**: Add patterns for plugins you never want recommended
- **preferred_tools**: Override ranking algorithm for specific task types

## Examples

### Conservative Setup (Manual Control)
```yaml
proactive_suggestions: false
auto_use_threshold: 1.0  # Never auto-use
suggestion_threshold: 0.85
scan_frequency: manual
verbosity: quiet
```

### Aggressive Setup (Maximum Automation)
```yaml
proactive_suggestions: true
auto_use_threshold: 0.75
suggestion_threshold: 0.60
scan_on_start: true
scan_frequency: hourly
verbosity: verbose
show_scores: true
```

### Balanced Setup (Recommended)
```yaml
proactive_suggestions: true
auto_use_threshold: 0.90
suggestion_threshold: 0.70
scan_on_start: true
scan_frequency: hourly
verbosity: normal
show_scores: true
```
